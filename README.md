# UX-Redesign

## Background and Motivation:
<p>We chose Craigslist because our motive was to improve Craigslist in terms of UI and create a better user experience for
all the users as we felt that the website lagsin terms of UI/UX features as compared to big companies like eBay. We wanted
to make it more intuitive, user-friendly, and improve the usability of the site that will result in positive user experience and
make the site more popular. This site is relevant to us as we use it to buy and sell used items. Also, we use this site to find
part-time jobs. In 1995, Craig Newmark founded Craigslist which started its service as a mailing list and featured only
local events in San Francisco. But later, Craigslist launched itsweb service in 1996.In 2000,Craig hired several employees
to expand the coverage of the website to other countries. Later, Craigslist gained popularity in more than 70 countries and
now is considered an American classified advertisement website. Craigslist is becoming more popular day by day abut
still lags in terms of UI and UX. There are some similar website/applications available such as Alibaba, and Kijiji which,
is also famous but they don't allow to search for jobs. Craigslist is a free ad posting website, and we use it to post the ads
for the items we want to sell and buy or find jobs by contacting the relevant ad owner on email or phone.</p>

<h2> Description of the Users:
  </h2>
<p> Craigslist is used by anyone who wants to buy, sell, hire, and post ads for the same. Apart from us, Senior citizens and
adults also use this website to sell or buy new/used items. Also, professionals use this website to find job opportunities.
The common characteristic among users is trust, as Craigslist winds diverse groups together. Also, convenience, choice,
value, and selection are some more characteristics that users look for while using Craigslist.

Also, it is important for us to understand the age group of the users to know about their use of the Craigslist. For instance,
the students usually use Craigslist to sell their old phones, mattress, phones, books, laptops, etc.
The intended audience can be categorized as:
<ul>
  <li>
 Seller - A seller is one who posts advertisements regarding selling a product on Craigslist. We have sold many
items on Craigslist such as cell-phones, mattresses, tables and etc. For selling an item we post an ad regarding the
same.<li>
  <li>
 Buyer â€“ The buyer usually looks for advertisements on Craigslist and contacts the seller for buying the product.
    We use craigslist to buy used items such as a table, chair, mattress, phone, car, etc.</li>
  <li>
Recruiter - A recruiter is the one who posts an ad for the job opening to hire a suitable candidate for any firm or
organization. Recruiter is usually a working professional. Generally, managers use this portal to post an ad to
    recruit new employees in their company</li>
  <li>
Jobseeker: Job seekers are anyone who is looking for job opportunities. The job can be part-time and full time. In most
cases, students seek part-time jobs and adults from the age group 25-35 look for full-time job opportunities.
  </li>
  
Craigslist supports 15 different languages and has approximately sixty million users. Moreover, we found that the website is
viewed by 50 million users every month and has 50 million daily queries. It is known that the website is mainly focused on
buying, selling, and requesting services so the people older than 15 years of age are the main users.</p>

<h2> Identification of Opportunities for Redesign: </h2>
<p>
We explored both common and specific task and found the following opportunities:
  <ul>
    <li>
Many Redundant Links Used: The homepage contains a lot of redundant links such as help, privacy, feedback,
safety, and many more. This means screen space is not prioritized and given less importance, and new users have
      a hard time finding relevant material.</li>
<li>
 Absence of Consistent Navigation Bar: No navigation menu appears consistently throughout the website. This
  makes navigating across the website difficult.</li>
    <li>
Vague Event Calendar: There is no indication of the month on the event calendar. It does not allow us to search
      for events in future months and view past events.</li>
<li>Changing Location is time-consuming: It takes time to change location as we have to find through the list of
  locations. Also, Craigslist does not allow us to input a zip code on the home page.</li>
<li>Misleading Labels: Misleading and inappropriate labels are used which do not justify the category. For example,
  atv/utv/sno and materials for sale category can be better represented.</li>
<li>Discussion Forum is not user-friendly: A new user faces a hard time to get used to the forum. Also, adding
messages to the forum is not user-friendly. We have to add a handle and then only publish a message on the
discussion forum.</li>
<li> No Built-in Chat Feature: No personal chat box available on Craigslist to fasten communication between buyer
and seller. Instead, it is done using e-mail or call.</li
<li>No Proper Guide for Signing up and Managing Account: Managing an account and Signing up is difficult as
Craigslist does not provide proper guidelines about how to create a strong password and what are the
  requirements.</li>
<li>No fixed resolution set: Ifthe selection of the language is changed, we can notice the width automatically changes.
  Some pages expand in width, and thus resolution is not fixed.</li>
    <li>
No Rating System: There is no way to rate the products we have bought from Craigslist. This makes the website
less user-friendly and trustable.</li>
  </p>
  
## Support for Identified Opportunities:
<p>
  We found that links on the left panel and at the bottom bar are redundant. For example, "terms of use" link in the left
panel and "terms" at the bottom bar are redundant links on the homepage which are not required. Also, while posting an
ad, we have to select the appropriate, category and sub-category and if the user chooses the wrong category, then we
are forced to navigate back to the home page and again start the process which creates inconvenience. Therefore, a
consistent navigation bar is required to ease the task. Also, the event calendar is not of use, as it does not help us in any
task, and future events cannot be accessed. We noticed that the resolution in mobile is not fixed and some images were
going out of the marked area.
While creating an account on the Craigslist, we noticed that it does not allow us to proceed further with the process
unless the password is strong enough. Also, it does not provide any guidelines to fulfill the requirements for a strong
password. We noticed it provided only two instructions as depicted above which, were not much of help, because it
does not mention the minimum password length. But after a few tries, we figured out that the minimum password length
is 6. Hence, we thought proper guidelines should be made available for the users. We tried to enter our feedback to the
android/iOS discussion forum but was alerted with a message to add a handle to your account. To add a handle, we have
to sign in again, even if we are already signed in. Hence it is a time consuming and tedious task. Few labels like etc./misc.
under jobs do not clearly state what it means, and we have to go and check for such type of category.
While using Craigslist, we tried to search for renting an apartment, but for communication, the process was not
convenient for reaching on emails to the owner. Instead, it is moreconvenient to have an in-built personalized chatbox
for such a conversation. Also, we felt the requirement of a rating system on the site like Craigslist as it will help the new
user to contact the right seller. </p>
